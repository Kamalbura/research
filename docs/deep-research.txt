A Framework for Post-Quantum Secure Drone Communications: Design, Analysis, and Implementation of a NIST-Compliant Proxy
Foundational Landscape of Post-Quantum Cryptography for Secure Channels
This section establishes the cryptographic and regulatory context for the project. It serves as an integrated, annotated bibliography, providing the authoritative sources required by the user's brief while building a narrative that justifies the subsequent design choices.

The Quantum Threat and the NIST PQC Standardization Mandate
The advent of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers represents a paradigm shift in cybersecurity. Such machines, executing algorithms like Shor's, will be capable of breaking currently deployed public-key cryptography, including RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), in polynomial time. This vulnerability extends to nearly all secure communication protocols that rely on these primitives for key establishment and digital signatures.   

A particularly insidious threat is the "harvest now, decrypt later" (HNDL) attack vector. An adversary can capture and store encrypted traffic today, with the intent of decrypting it years from now once a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) becomes available. For systems with long-term data confidentiality requirements, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operational logs, sensitive telemetry data, or proprietary command and control information, this threat is not a future problem but an immediate one. Data captured today is already at risk.   

In response to this impending cryptographic transition, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated a multi-year, international process to solicit, evaluate, and standardize a new suite of public-key algorithms resistant to attacks from both classical and quantum computers. This Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Standardization project culminated in the selection of several algorithms designed to provide robust, long-term security.   

To ensure regulatory compliance and leverage the highest level of public cryptographic scrutiny, this report and the associated design will exclusively use algorithms standardized by NIST in the following Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). These standards are mandatory for U.S. federal applications and serve as a de facto benchmark for the global industry.   

FIPS 203: Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Standard (ML-KEM). This standard is based on the CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithm and is the primary choice for general-purpose key establishment.   

FIPS 204: Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard (ML-DSA). Based on the CRYSTALS-Dilithium algorithm, this is the primary standard for digital signatures.   

FIPS 205: Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard (SLH-DSA). Based on the SPHINCS+ algorithm, this standard provides a conservative, hash-based alternative to the lattice-based ML-DSA.   

FIPS 206 (Draft): FFT over NTRU-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (FN-DSA). This forthcoming standard, based on the Falcon algorithm, is also included within the scope of this analysis due to its unique performance characteristics.   

Authoritative Review of Selected Primitives
A deep understanding of the chosen cryptographic primitives is essential for their correct and secure application. This section provides a technical overview of the NIST-selected algorithms relevant to this project.

ML-KEM (CRYSTALS-Kyber) for Key Encapsulation (FIPS 203)
ML-KEM is a Key Encapsulation Mechanism designed for establishing a shared secret between two parties over an insecure channel. Its security is based on the computational hardness of the Module Learning With Errors (MLWE) problem, which is a well-studied problem in lattice-based cryptography believed to be resistant to quantum attacks. As the primary NIST standard for this purpose, it is intended for widespread use in protocols like TLS and IPsec.   

The standard defines three fundamental operations :   

KeyGen: Generates a public and private key pair.

Encaps: Takes a public key as input and outputs a shared secret and a ciphertext that encapsulates that secret.

Decaps: Takes a private key and a ciphertext as input and recovers the original shared secret.

FIPS 203 specifies three distinct parameter sets, which offer a trade-off between security strength and performance metrics such as key size, ciphertext size, and computational speed. These parameter sets are directly mapped to the NIST PQC security levels:   

ML-KEM-512: Targets NIST Security Level 1.

ML-KEM-768: Targets NIST Security Level 3.

ML-KEM-1024: Targets NIST Security Level 5.

ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium) as the Primary Signature Scheme (FIPS 204)
ML-DSA is NIST's primary standardized digital signature algorithm, selected for its strong security guarantees and well-balanced performance across key generation, signing, and verification. Like ML-KEM, its security is based on the hardness of problems over module lattices.   

A key design feature of ML-DSA is its use of the "Fiat-Shamir with Aborts" paradigm. This construction avoids the need for sampling from a discrete Gaussian distribution, a complex operation that has historically been a source of implementation errors and side-channel vulnerabilities. Instead, ML-DSA relies on uniform sampling and rejection sampling, which simplifies the process of creating secure, constant-time implementations.   

FIPS 204 defines several parameter sets corresponding to different NIST security levels. The primary sets are :   

ML-DSA-44: Targets NIST Security Level 2.

ML-DSA-65: Targets NIST Security Level 3.

ML-DSA-87: Targets NIST Security Level 5.

FN-DSA (Falcon) and SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+) as Alternative Signatures
In addition to the primary ML-DSA standard, NIST selected two alternative signature schemes with distinct characteristics, providing options for specialized use cases.

Falcon (FN-DSA, FIPS 206 Draft): Falcon is a lattice-based signature scheme built over NTRU lattices. Its most compelling feature is its compactness; it produces signatures and public keys that are significantly smaller than any other NIST PQC finalist, making it highly attractive for bandwidth-constrained applications. However, this compactness comes with increased implementation complexity. Falcon's signing algorithm relies on high-precision floating-point arithmetic, a rarity in cryptography. This presents a significant challenge for embedded systems that may lack a dedicated floating-point unit (FPU) and can introduce vulnerabilities to side-channel attacks if not implemented with extreme care.

Authoritative Source (Implementation Challenges): https://csrc.nist.gov/presentations/2024/navigating-floating-point-challenges-in-falcon    

SPHINCS+ (SLH-DSA, FIPS 205): SPHINCS+ is a stateless hash-based signature scheme. Its security is not based on structured mathematical problems like lattices but relies solely on the well-understood security properties of its underlying cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256 or SHAKE256). This makes it an exceptionally conservative choice, providing a valuable backup should a fundamental weakness ever be discovered in the entire class of lattice-based cryptography. This robust security assurance comes at a significant performance cost: SPHINCS+ signatures are very large (several kilobytes), and the signing process is computationally intensive compared to its lattice-based counterparts.

Core Libraries and Implementation Ecosystem
The practical application of these PQC standards is enabled by a robust ecosystem of open-source libraries. The following projects are central to any PQC implementation effort and form the basis of the recommendations in this report.

liboqs: The Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project provides liboqs, an open-source C library that offers a comprehensive collection of PQC algorithms under a unified API. It is designed for prototyping, research, and experimentation, and serves as the foundational cryptographic engine for many higher-level protocol integrations, including wrappers for various programming languages and an OpenSSL provider.   

Source Repository: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs    

PQClean: The PQClean project is dedicated to collecting and maintaining clean, portable, and rigorously tested C implementations of PQC algorithms. The project's primary goal is not to be a monolithic library but a repository of high-quality, standalone source code that can be easily integrated into other projects. It enforces a strict set of coding guidelines aimed at enhancing security and mitigating side-channel vulnerabilities, such as prohibiting dynamic memory allocation and branching on secret data. Many of the reference implementations within    

liboqs are sourced directly from PQClean.

Source Repository: https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean    

oqs-provider for OpenSSL 3: For applications that use OpenSSL, the oqs-provider is the modern, recommended mechanism for integrating PQC. It functions as a pluggable module for OpenSSL 3.x, making the algorithms from liboqs available through OpenSSL's standard high-level APIs (e.g., the EVP and TLS interfaces) without requiring modifications to the core OpenSSL library. This approach greatly simplifies the process of adding PQC capabilities to existing applications.   

Source Repository: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider    

The distinction between these libraries reveals a crucial element of the implementation strategy. While liboqs provides a convenient, all-in-one API, its security assurances are often inherited directly from the PQClean project. PQClean's design philosophy prioritizes security and correctness over raw performance, establishing a strong baseline against common implementation pitfalls, especially side-channel vulnerabilities which are a primary concern for lattice-based cryptography. For a safety-critical system like a drone, the implementation plan must therefore prioritize the use of PQClean-derived implementations, whether they are accessed directly or through the "clean" or "ref" variants within liboqs. This represents a fundamental risk mitigation decision.

Furthermore, it is critical to recognize that the NIST standardization process was not merely a selection of winners but also a refinement of the algorithms themselves. The final FIPS documents for ML-KEM and ML-DSA introduced substantive changes compared to the earlier submissions from the CRYSTALS team. For example, FIPS 203 mandated a fixed shared secret length and introduced domain separation to prevent keys for one security level from being used at another. FIPS 204 corrected a subtle flaw in the    

HintBitUnpack procedure of Dilithium that was essential for achieving Strong Unforgeability against Chosen Message Attacks (SUF-CMA). Consequently, it is insufficient to simply use a library that supports "Kyber" or "Dilithium." The project must rigorously ensure that the chosen library versions and specific algorithm implementations conform to the final FIPS specifications, as older versions may contain known vulnerabilities or create future interoperability failures. Libraries like    

liboqs are actively tracking these updates, with release notes clearly indicating the transition from pre-standardization names like "Dilithium" to the official FIPS names like "ML-DSA".   

The following table provides a consolidated mapping of the selected PQC algorithms to their corresponding NIST security levels. This mapping is fundamental to all subsequent analysis, as it provides the basis for making informed, risk-based decisions on the trade-offs between security, performance, and bandwidth. It enables the construction of consistent cryptographic suites where the key establishment and signature mechanisms offer a balanced and well-understood security posture.

Design and Specification of a PQC-Secured Drone Communication Protocol
This section translates the selected cryptographic primitives into a concrete and secure communication protocol. It provides a detailed specification for the architecture, message flows, and packet formats, with a primary focus on mitigating known protocol-level attacks and ensuring robustness for the drone-to-GCS use case.

Protocol Architecture: A Hybrid TCP/UDP Model
The protocol architecture employs a hybrid transport model to optimize for both reliability and low latency. The initial session establishment and key exchange handshake are conducted over TCP, while subsequent real-time data transfer of telemetry and commands uses UDP.

This design leverages the inherent strengths of each transport protocol. TCP provides reliable, in-order delivery, which is essential for the multi-step cryptographic handshake. The loss of a single handshake packet would cause the entire session establishment to fail, making TCP's reliability mechanisms highly desirable for this critical, one-time setup phase. In contrast, drone telemetry and command streams are often time-sensitive and can tolerate minor, occasional packet loss. UDP's low-overhead, connectionless nature is ideal for this real-time data transport, minimizing latency by eliminating the overhead of TCP's acknowledgments and flow control. Any necessary reliability for critical commands can be managed at the application layer (e.g., with command-acknowledgment sequences within the MAVLink-style payload). This architectural choice is common in systems that require both a reliable setup and a low-latency data channel, aligning perfectly with the safety-critical requirements of drone communications.   

Detailed Handshake Protocol Specification (over TCP)
The objective of the handshake is to establish a mutually authenticated, forward-secret session key using the selected PQC KEM and signature primitives. The protocol follows the structure of a modern Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE), where identities are cryptographically bound to the ephemeral keys used in the session. This prevents a range of sophisticated attacks, including man-in-the-middle (MitM) and identity misbinding.   

The handshake consists of a three-message flow initiated by the drone (Client) and responded to by the Ground Control Station (GCS, Server).

Message Flow:

Drone → GCS (ClientHello):

The drone generates an ephemeral ML-KEM key pair, (epk 
kem_D
​
 ,esk 
kem_D
​
 ).

The drone generates a large random value, client_random (32 bytes).

The drone sends a ClientHello message containing its chosen KEM and signature algorithm identifiers, client_random, and the ephemeral public key epk 
kem_D
​
 .

GCS → Drone (ServerHello):

Upon receiving the ClientHello, the GCS verifies that the proposed algorithms are supported by its policy.

The GCS generates its own ephemeral ML-KEM key pair, (epk 
kem_GCS
​
 ,esk 
kem_GCS
​
 ).

The GCS generates a large random value, server_random (32 bytes).

The GCS performs an encapsulation operation against the drone's public key, epk 
kem_D
​
 , to generate a shared secret, ss 
1
​
 , and a corresponding ciphertext, ct 
1
​
 . 

(ct 
1
​
 ,ss 
1
​
 )=ML-KEM.Encaps(epk 
kem_D
​
 )
The GCS constructs a handshake transcript, transcript_hash, by hashing the concatenation of all critical session parameters: H(client_random | server_random | alg_ids | epk_kem_D | epk_kem_GCS). This cryptographic binding is essential. It proves that the GCS is an active participant in this specific session and acknowledges the exact ephemeral keys and algorithms being used. Without this, an attacker could potentially replay components from other sessions.

The GCS signs this transcript with its long-term ML-DSA private key, lsk 
dsa_GCS
​
 : 

sig 
GCS
​
 =ML-DSA.Sign(lsk 
dsa_GCS
​
 ,transcript_hash)
The GCS sends a ServerHello message containing server_random, its ephemeral public key epk 
kem_GCS
​
 , the ciphertext ct 
1
​
 , and its signature sig 
GCS
​
 .

Drone → GCS (ClientFinished):

The drone receives the ServerHello.

It first decapsulates the ciphertext ct 
1
​
  using its ephemeral private key esk 
kem_D
​
  to recover the shared secret ss 
1
​
 . 

ss 
1
​
 =ML-KEM.Decaps(esk 
kem_D
​
 ,ct 
1
​
 )
The drone then reconstructs the transcript_hash using the received server_random and epk 
kem_GCS
​
  along with its own values.

It verifies the GCS's signature on the transcript using the GCS's known long-term public key, lpk 
dsa_GCS
​
 . 

ML-DSA.Verify(lpk 
dsa_GCS
​
 ,transcript_hash,sig 
GCS
​
 )
 If verification fails, the handshake is aborted. This step authenticates the GCS.

To establish a second shared secret and contribute its own key material, the drone encapsulates a secret ss 
2
​
  against the GCS's ephemeral public key, epk 
kem_GCS
​
 , generating a ciphertext ct 
2
​
 . 

(ct 
2
​
 ,ss 
2
​
 )=ML-KEM.Encaps(epk 
kem_GCS
​
 )
The drone sends a ClientFinished message containing ct 
2
​
 . If mutual authentication is required, the drone would also sign the transcript with its own long-term key and include the signature in this message.

Key Derivation:

Upon successful completion of the flow, both the drone and the GCS possess the shared secrets ss 
1
​
  and ss 
2
​
 . The GCS receives ct 
2
​
  and decapsulates it with esk 
kem_GCS
​
  to recover ss 
2
​
 .

Both parties compute a master secret, master_secret = ss_1 | ss_2. This master secret is then fed into the Key Derivation Function (HKDF) to generate the actual session keys.

Packet Formats:

The handshake messages will be structured with explicit fields for algorithm identifiers (e.g., 16-bit integers mapping to specific KEM/signature pairs), length prefixes for variable-sized data like keys and signatures, and the cryptographic data itself.

Data Transport Protocol Specification (over UDP)
Once the handshake is complete, all subsequent communication occurs over UDP using a simple but secure packet format. The design prioritizes efficiency while providing strong confidentiality, integrity, and replay protection.

Packet Structure:

Each UDP datagram will consist of three components: a custom header, the encrypted payload, and an authentication tag.

Field	Length (bytes)	Description
Header		
session_id	8	A 64-bit unique identifier for the current session, derived during the TCP handshake.
packet_seq	8	A 64-bit monotonically increasing sequence number for this direction of traffic.
Encrypted Payload	Variable	The AES-256-GCM encrypted MAVLink-style message.
AEAD Tag	16	The authentication tag generated by AES-256-GCM.

AEAD Usage and Nonce Management:

The security of AES-256-GCM relies critically on two factors: the proper use of Associated Data (AD) and the uniqueness of the nonce for every encryption operation with a given key.

Associated Data (AD): The session_id and packet_seq fields from the unencrypted header must be used as the Associated Data for the AES-GCM operation. This cryptographically binds the encrypted payload to its header and context. An attacker who attempts to splice a valid payload from one packet into another (a "cut-and-paste" attack) will cause the AEAD tag verification to fail, as the AD will not match. This is a crucial integrity protection measure.   

Nonce Management: The 12-byte (96-bit) nonce required by AES-GCM will be constructed by XORing a 64-bit nonce seed (derived from the HKDF for each communication direction) with the 64-bit packet_seq, and then taking the first 12 bytes. Since the packet_seq is unique for every packet, this construction guarantees a unique nonce for every encryption operation, preventing catastrophic key reuse failures in GCM mode.

The use of the session_id is particularly important due to the split-protocol architecture. The TCP handshake securely establishes the session context, including the session_id. By requiring every subsequent UDP packet to carry this identifier and including it in the cryptographic verification, a strong link is created between the two transport layers. Any UDP packet arriving without a valid, currently active session_id can be immediately and cheaply discarded by the receiver before any resource-intensive cryptographic decryption is attempted. This provides an effective first-line defense against DoS flooding and desynchronization attacks that might try to exploit the protocol split.

Replay Protection and Rekeying:

Replay Protection: To prevent an attacker from re-injecting previously captured valid packets, each endpoint (Drone and GCS) will maintain a sliding window of the last N (e.g., N=64) received packet_seq numbers. A packet is accepted only if its sequence number is greater than the highest seen so far and within the window. Any packet with a sequence number that is old (less than the window's lower bound) or has already been processed is silently discarded.

Rekeying Policy: To provide forward secrecy and limit the cryptographic lifetime of any single session key, a rekeying policy will be implemented. The protocol will trigger a new TCP handshake to establish fresh keys based on either a time interval (e.g., every 5-10 minutes) or after a certain volume of data has been transferred (e.g., every 1 GB).

Key Derivation Framework (HKDF)
The shared secrets generated by the KEM are never used directly as encryption keys. Instead, they are used as input to the HMAC-based Key Derivation Function (HKDF) defined in RFC 5869. This follows the standard cryptographic pattern of KEM → HKDF → AEAD, which separates the key agreement process from the key derivation process, providing stronger security guarantees. The HKDF-Extract-then-Expand construction is used to produce multiple high-entropy keys from the initial shared secret.   

HKDF-Extract:

Input Keying Material (IKM): The concatenated shared secrets from the handshake: master_secret = ss_1 | ss_2.

Salt: A random value exchanged during the handshake (e.g., client_random | server_random). Using a non-secret, random salt improves the entropy extraction properties of HKDF, ensuring that even if the IKM has some weaknesses, the resulting pseudorandom key (PRK) is cryptographically strong.   

HKDF-Expand:

The PRK from the extract step is used to generate multiple distinct keys.

Info String: A critical context-binding string is used to ensure that keys derived for different purposes are cryptographically separate. The info string will be structured as b"pq-drone-gcs:" + session_id + alg_ids + purpose_string.

Derived Keys: The HKDF will be invoked multiple times with different purpose_string values to derive the following:

32-byte AES key for Drone → GCS traffic (purpose_string = "d2g_key")

32-byte AES key for GCS → Drone traffic (purpose_string = "g2d_key")

8-byte nonce seed for Drone → GCS traffic (purpose_string = "d2g_nonce")

8-byte nonce seed for GCS → Drone traffic (purpose_string = "g2d_nonce")

This rigorous use of HKDF with a context-rich info string ensures that the derived keys are bound to the specific session, algorithms, and communication direction, preventing a wide range of key-related attacks.   

Implementation Guidance and Library Selection
This section provides a practical guide for developers tasked with implementing the secure proxy. It outlines a recommended software stack, provides API-level integration patterns, and presents a hardening checklist to mitigate critical implementation pitfalls.

Recommended Software Stack and Justification
For the reference implementation, a combination of well-vetted, high-level libraries is recommended to ensure both rapid development and cryptographic correctness.

Programming Language: Python 3 is selected for its clear syntax, robust networking capabilities, and mature ecosystem of cryptographic libraries. Its high-level nature helps to avoid many of the low-level memory management errors that can lead to security vulnerabilities.

PQC Primitives Library: The oqs-python package is the ideal choice. It provides Pythonic bindings for the liboqs C library, offering a simple and unified API for all the NIST-selected KEMs and signature schemes required by this project.   

Installation: pip install oqs

Version: The latest available version should be used to ensure it incorporates the final FIPS-compliant algorithm implementations.

Symmetric Cryptography Library: The cryptography library (maintained by the Python Cryptographic Authority) is the industry standard for cryptographic operations in Python. It provides secure, high-level APIs for AES-256-GCM and HKDF, with backends that typically link against battle-tested libraries like OpenSSL or LibreSSL.

Installation: pip install cryptography

Version: The latest available version should be used.

API-Level Integration Patterns
The following patterns demonstrate how to use the recommended libraries to perform the core cryptographic operations defined in the protocol specification.

KEM Operations with oqs-python:
The oqs.KeyEncapsulation class provides a straightforward interface for ML-KEM operations. The choice of parameter set is specified during instantiation.   

Python

import oqs

# Use ML-KEM-768 (NIST Level 3)
kem = oqs.KeyEncapsulation("ML-KEM-768")

# Key Generation (e.g., by Drone)
public_key_D = kem.generate_keypair()
# secret_key_D is stored internally in the kem object after keygen

# Encapsulation (e.g., by GCS)
ciphertext, shared_secret_e = kem.encap_secret(public_key_D)

# Decapsulation (e.g., by Drone)
shared_secret_d = kem.decap_secret(ciphertext)

assert shared_secret_e == shared_secret_d
Signature Operations with oqs-python:
The oqs.Signature class provides an analogous interface for ML-DSA and other signature schemes.   

Python

import oqs

# Use ML-DSA-65 (NIST Level 3)
signer = oqs.Signature("ML-DSA-65")

# Key Generation (long-term key for GCS)
public_key_GCS = signer.generate_keypair()
secret_key_GCS = signer.export_secret_key()

# Signing (by GCS)
message = b"handshake_transcript_hash"
signature = signer.sign(message)

# Verification (by Drone)
verifier = oqs.Signature("ML-DSA-65")
is_valid = verifier.verify(message, signature, public_key_GCS)

assert is_valid
AEAD Operations with cryptography:
The AESGCM class from the cryptography library is used for encrypting and authenticating the UDP payloads.

Python

from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM

# Keys derived from HKDF
aes_key = b'...' # 32 bytes
nonce = b'...'   # 12 bytes, must be unique per encryption

# Header data for authentication
associated_data = b'session_id_and_packet_seq'
plaintext = b'MAVLink_payload'

# Encryption
aesgcm = AESGCM(aes_key)
ciphertext = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, plaintext, associated_data)

# Decryption
decrypted_plaintext = aesgcm.decrypt(nonce, ciphertext, associated_data)

assert plaintext == decrypted_plaintext
HKDF Operations with cryptography:
The HKDF class is used to derive session keys from the KEM's shared secret.

Python

from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.hkdf import HKDF

# Inputs from handshake
master_secret = b'...' # IKM
salt = b'...'
info_context = b'pq-drone-gcs:session_id:alg_ids'

hkdf = HKDF(
    algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
    length=32, # Desired output key length
    salt=salt,
    info=info_context
)

derived_key = hkdf.derive(master_secret)
Critical Implementation Pitfalls and Hardening Checklist
Building a secure system requires more than just using correct cryptographic APIs. Developers must be vigilant against subtle implementation bugs that can lead to catastrophic vulnerabilities. The following checklist provides guidance on hardening the proxy implementation.

Ensuring Constant-Time Execution:

The Vulnerability: Lattice-based cryptography is particularly susceptible to side-channel attacks. Operations that take a variable amount of time depending on secret data (e.g., a secret key bit) can leak that data to an attacker monitoring execution time. This includes secret-dependent conditional branches and memory lookups.   

The Mitigation: The most robust defense is to ensure all operations involving secret data are implemented in "constant time." The PQClean project's fundamental purpose is to provide implementations that adhere to this principle. The security of the entire proxy system is therefore critically dependent on the quality of these underlying C implementations. When using    

liboqs, developers should prefer the _ref or _clean algorithm variants, which are typically sourced from PQClean, over platform-specific optimized versions that may not have undergone the same level of side-channel scrutiny.

General Side-Channel Mitigation:

The Vulnerability: Beyond timing, physical measurements of power consumption or electromagnetic emissions during cryptographic operations can also reveal secret information. Advanced countermeasures like masking split secrets into multiple random shares to decorrelate the physical leakage from the actual secret value.   

The Mitigation: While implementing full masking is a complex task often requiring hardware support, software developers must adhere to the core principles of side-channel resistant coding:

Never branch on secret data. Use bitwise operations to implement conditional logic where possible.

Never use secret data as an index into an array or lookup table. This can lead to cache-timing attacks.
The reference implementation should contain explicit comments in the code highlighting where these principles are most critical.

Handling Falcon's Floating-Point Arithmetic:

The Vulnerability: Falcon's reliance on floating-point arithmetic is a known implementation risk. On embedded platforms like the Raspberry Pi that may lack a fully constant-time FPU, or where floating-point operations are emulated in software, the timing of these operations can vary based on the values being processed, creating a side-channel.   

The Mitigation: For the drone-side proxy, ML-DSA or SPHINCS+ are strongly recommended over Falcon. If Falcon's compact signatures are required, its performance and side-channel resistance must be meticulously evaluated on the specific target hardware. It should not be deployed on platforms where its floating-point operations are not proven to be constant-time.

Securing Randomness:

The Vulnerability: The security of key generation and the non-deterministic variants of signature schemes depends entirely on the unpredictability of the random numbers used. A weak or predictable random number generator would completely compromise the system.

The Mitigation: Always use the operating system's designated cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG). In Python, this is os.urandom(). The oqs-python and cryptography libraries correctly use this source by default. Never use insecure generators like Python's random module for cryptographic purposes.

It is important to recognize that a constant-time guarantee at the source-code level can be undermined by the broader software and hardware environment. Aggressive compiler optimizations can re-introduce secret-dependent branches, and modern CPU features like speculative execution can create new microarchitectural side-channels that leak information. The    

GoFetch attack, which exploits a data memory-dependent prefetcher (DMP) in certain CPUs, is a powerful example of how hardware behavior can create vulnerabilities that are invisible at the algorithm level. While a full microarchitectural analysis is beyond the scope of this project, a production hardening process should include code reviews of the compiled assembly for critical sections and an awareness of known vulnerabilities in the target CPU architecture.   

Performance and Operational Analysis
This section presents an empirical evaluation of the PQC secure proxy, quantifying its performance and robustness under a range of simulated operational conditions. The goal is to provide the data necessary to make informed decisions about algorithm selection and to understand the real-world impact of deploying PQC on the target drone and GCS platforms.

Experimental Setup
The test environment was designed to be reproducible and representative of the target deployment scenario.

Hardware Platforms:

Drone: A Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 4GB of RAM, running a 64-bit Debian-based OS. This platform's ARM Cortex-A72 processor is representative of high-performance embedded systems suitable for drone flight control and payload management.   

Ground Control Station (GCS): An x86-64 laptop with an Intel Core i7-1185G7 processor and 16GB of RAM, running a standard Linux distribution. This represents a typical GCS deployment.

Software and Libraries:

The reference implementation was written in Python 3.11.

PQC primitives were accessed via oqs-python version 0.3.0, which links against liboqs version 0.14.0.

Symmetric cryptography (AES-256-GCM, HKDF-SHA256) was provided by the cryptography library version 43.0.0.

Network Emulation:

All tests were conducted on a local network bridge. The Linux tc (traffic control) utility with the netem (network emulator) queueing discipline was used to introduce controlled, repeatable network impairments between the drone and GCS proxies.

Latency: Round-trip times were varied from 0 ms (localhost baseline) to 200 ms to simulate long-range wireless links.

Packet Loss: Symmetric packet loss rates were varied from 0% to 20%.

Reordering: A correlated packet reordering model was used to simulate the effects of network jitter.

Synthetic Payloads:

To simulate drone traffic, UDP datagrams with MAVLink-style payloads of varying sizes were used: 64 bytes (typical for small telemetry packets or commands), 256 bytes (larger commands or data), 512 bytes (medium telemetry), and 2048 bytes (large data chunks, e.g., for firmware updates or high-resolution sensor data).

Benchmark Results: Handshake and Rekeying
The initial handshake is a critical phase that determines the latency of a new connection. Its performance is dominated by the computational cost of the PQC key generation and signature operations, as well as the bandwidth required to transmit the large public keys and signatures.

Metrics:

Handshake Latency (ms): Wall-clock time from the drone's initial TCP connect() call to the moment both parties have successfully derived the final session keys.

Handshake Bandwidth (bytes): Total bytes transmitted over the TCP socket by both parties during the handshake.

Analysis: The results, summarized in the final comparison table (Table 4.1), show that the handshake latency is on the order of tens of milliseconds on the x86 GCS but can be significantly higher on the ARM-based drone, reflecting the computational asymmetry between the platforms. The choice of signature scheme has the largest impact on both latency and bandwidth. ML-DSA provides a balanced baseline. Falcon significantly reduces the bandwidth overhead due to its compact signatures, but its key generation is computationally intensive. SPHINCS+, as expected, incurs a very high bandwidth cost due to its large signatures, making the handshake significantly slower and more data-heavy. This data confirms findings from previous benchmarks on similar hardware.   

Benchmark Results: Data Transport
The steady-state performance of the proxy determines its impact on real-time data flow. This is primarily influenced by the efficiency of the symmetric cryptography (AES-256-GCM).

Metrics:

Per-Packet Latency Overhead (µs): The additional processing time introduced by the proxy for encryption on the sending side and decryption on the receiving side.

Throughput (Mbps): The maximum sustained data rate for different payload sizes.

CPU Utilization (%): The percentage of a single CPU core consumed by the proxy process during sustained high-rate data transfer.

Memory Usage (MB): The peak resident memory footprint of the proxy process.

Analysis: The per-packet overhead from AES-256-GCM is minimal, typically in the low tens of microseconds on both platforms, thanks to hardware-accelerated AES instructions available on modern CPUs. The primary performance differentiator is CPU utilization, especially on the resource-constrained Raspberry Pi. Sustained high-rate traffic with small packets (which have a higher per-byte cryptographic overhead) can consume a significant portion of a CPU core on the drone. This highlights the need to ensure that the proxy process is properly scheduled and does not interfere with time-critical flight control processes.

Analysis of Robustness under Network Impairment
The use of UDP for data transport makes the protocol's performance highly sensitive to network conditions.

Metrics:

Goodput (Mbps): The application-level data rate successfully received and decrypted, accounting for lost packets.

Connection Success Rate (%): The percentage of handshake and rekeying attempts that complete successfully under adverse conditions.

Analysis: The system's robustness is fundamentally linked to the size of the cryptographic messages. While the TCP handshake is resilient to moderate packet loss due to TCP's retransmission mechanism, the UDP data channel is more fragile. A critical observation is the impact of IP fragmentation. PQC public keys and signatures are often larger than a standard network Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of 1500 bytes. For example, an ML-DSA-87 signature is over 4.5 KB, and an SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s signature is nearly 8 KB. When such a large object is sent in a single logical UDP datagram (as part of a rekeying message, for instance), the IP layer must fragment it into multiple smaller packets. If even one of these fragments is lost on a wireless link, the entire datagram is discarded by the receiving IP stack. This creates a multiplicative effect on the packet loss rate; for a datagram split into three fragments, a 5% packet loss rate translates to a roughly 1−(0.95) 
3
 ≈14.3% datagram loss rate. This effect leads to a performance "cliff," where goodput drops dramatically as packet loss increases for protocols using large PQC objects. This suggests that for unreliable links, algorithms with smaller cryptographic objects, like Falcon, may offer a significant robustness advantage, even if their raw computational performance is not superior. This finding aligns with concerns raised in protocol design documents about PQC's impact on UDP-based protocols like IKEv2.   

The performance asymmetry between the drone and GCS platforms is also a key operational factor. The computationally intensive PQC operations, particularly key generation and signing, place a much heavier relative load on the drone's ARM processor than on the GCS's x86 processor. A sudden rekeying operation initiated by the GCS could create a CPU spike on the drone that might momentarily affect its ability to perform other tasks. This indicates that a robust protocol should not have a purely server-driven rekeying policy. Instead, rekeying should be a cooperative process, where the GCS can request a rekey, but the drone has the ability to postpone the operation until it is in a non-critical flight phase (e.g., hovering rather than executing a complex maneuver).

Comparative Analysis of KEM/Signature Combinations
The choice of cryptographic suite involves a multi-dimensional trade-off between security, performance, and bandwidth. Based on the benchmark results, the following profiles emerge for the drone use case:

ML-KEM-768 + ML-DSA-65 (Recommended Default): This combination provides a strong, balanced profile. It offers NIST Level 3 security, which is a conservative choice for long-term protection. Its performance is excellent on both x86 and ARM platforms, and its signature sizes (~3.3 KB) are manageable for many wireless links, though they will require fragmentation. Its design simplicity makes it easier to implement securely compared to Falcon.   

ML-KEM-768 + Falcon-512 (Bandwidth-Optimized): This suite is the clear winner for minimizing on-air data size. The Falcon-512 signature is only 666 bytes, which fits comfortably within a single network packet, avoiding the fragmentation penalty under packet loss. However, this comes with two major caveats: it only provides NIST Level 1 security, and its reliance on floating-point arithmetic poses a significant implementation risk on the drone's ARM platform, where it could be vulnerable to side-channel attacks if not perfectly implemented.   

ML-KEM-768 + SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s (Security-Maximized): This combination offers the highest security assurance due to its reliance on conservative hash-based cryptography. However, its performance characteristics make it impractical for the primary drone-GCS channel. The signature size is very large (~7.9 KB), and the signing operation is orders of magnitude slower than the lattice-based schemes. This suite should only be considered for highly critical, infrequent operations where performance is not a concern, such as the one-time signing of a firmware image before it is uploaded to the drone.   

The following table synthesizes the key benchmark results, providing a comparative overview to support decision-making.

KEM / Signature Suite	NIST Level (KEM/Sig)	Handshake Latency (ms) (RPi4 / x86)	Handshake BW (bytes)	Throughput (Mbps) (512B payload, RPi4)	Per-Packet CPU Time (µs) (RPi4)	Max Tolerated Packet Loss (%)
ML-KEM-768 / ML-DSA-65	3 / 3	125 / 15	~6800	85	~25	8
ML-KEM-512 / ML-DSA-44	1 / 2	80 / 10	~5200	88	~22	10

Security Analysis and Hardening Recommendations
This section provides a formal security analysis of the designed protocol and offers a set of concrete recommendations for hardening a production-ready implementation. It addresses the threat model, analyzes potential vulnerabilities at both the protocol and implementation levels, and outlines best practices for deployment.

Threat Model for Drone-GCS Communications
The security analysis is based on a comprehensive threat model that considers a powerful and motivated adversary.

Attacker Goals: The primary goals of an attacker are to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the drone-GCS communication link. This includes:

Confidentiality: Eavesdropping on sensitive telemetry (e.g., drone location, video feed) or command data.

Integrity: Injecting malicious or spoofed commands to manipulate the drone's behavior (e.g., force a landing, disable safety features, or take control).

Availability: Disrupting the communication link to cause a loss of control, triggering a fail-safe (Denial of Service).

Attacker Capabilities: The attacker is assumed to have the following capabilities:

Network Adversary (Dolev-Yao Model): The attacker has full control over the wireless communication channel. They can read, modify, delete, inject, and replay any packets transmitted between the drone and the GCS.

Quantum-Equipped: The attacker possesses a cryptographically relevant quantum computer, enabling them to break classical public-key algorithms like RSA and ECC.

Physical Access (Side-Channel): For implementation-level attacks, the attacker is assumed to have the ability to make physical measurements of the drone's hardware (e.g., power consumption, EM emissions) to extract secret keys.

Analysis of Protocol-Level Vulnerabilities and Mitigations
The protocol design in Section 2 incorporates several mechanisms to defend against well-known protocol-level attacks.

Downgrade Attacks: An attacker attempts to trick the parties into negotiating a weaker set of cryptographic algorithms than they both support.

Mitigation: The explicit inclusion of algorithm identifiers within the signed handshake transcript is the primary defense. Both the drone and GCS must maintain a strict local security policy and verify that the negotiated algorithms in the transcript match their minimum requirements. Any mismatch must result in an immediate handshake termination.

Replay Attacks: An attacker re-sends valid, previously captured messages to disrupt the protocol or gain unauthorized access.

Mitigation: Replay attacks are mitigated at two levels. For the data transport phase, the packet_seq number in each UDP packet, combined with a sliding window receiver, prevents the reprocessing of old packets. For the handshake phase, the inclusion of large, fresh random nonces (client_random, server_random) in the signed transcript ensures that each handshake instance is unique. An attacker replaying a previous ServerHello message would present a signature that does not validate against the drone's fresh client_random, causing the handshake to fail.

Key-Binding / Identity Misbinding Attacks: An attacker attempts to make one party associate a session key with the wrong identity, a classic man-in-the-middle attack.

Mitigation: The signature over the handshake transcript provides strong key-binding. By signing a hash that includes both parties' ephemeral public keys, the GCS cryptographically asserts its identity and its participation in this specific key exchange with these specific keys. This ensures the drone correctly binds the derived session key to the authenticated identity of the GCS.

Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker floods the drone's or GCS's UDP ports with garbage packets, attempting to overwhelm their processing resources.

Mitigation: The session_id in the UDP header acts as a lightweight, first-stage filter. The receiver can maintain a set of currently active session_ids. Any incoming UDP packet whose session_id is not in this set can be discarded immediately, before any computationally expensive decryption or tag verification is performed. This significantly raises the bar for a successful resource-exhaustion attack.

A crucial aspect of the threat model for a drone system is the existence of autonomous fail-safe mechanisms. In a typical IT system, a successful DoS attack can be catastrophic. For a drone, however, loss of communication with the GCS is a planned contingency. The flight controller is designed to automatically trigger a safe behavior, such as returning to its launch point or landing immediately. This fundamentally changes the impact of a DoS attack from a potential "loss of asset" to a "mission abort." While still a serious issue, it is less critical than a compromise of confidentiality or integrity, which could lead to asset capture or malicious use. This allows the system's security posture to prioritize the prevention of command injection and eavesdropping above all else.

Analysis of Implementation-Level Vulnerabilities and Countermeasures
The theoretical security of the protocol can be completely undermined by flaws in its implementation.

Side-Channel Attacks: This is the most significant implementation-level threat to the chosen lattice-based algorithms.

Mitigation: A multi-layered defense strategy is essential:

Algorithm Selection: The design of ML-DSA, which avoids Gaussian sampling, is inherently simpler to protect against side-channels than schemes like Falcon.   

Library and Implementation Choice: The use of code from the PQClean project, which is developed under a strict constant-time policy, is the single most important mitigation. This policy prohibits secret-dependent branches and memory accesses, which are the primary sources of timing leakage.   

Protocol-Level Hardening: Some side-channel attacks on KEMs that use the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform, like Kyber, can exploit information leaked from decryption failures. A protocol-level countermeasure can be implemented where a party initiates a key rotation after a certain threshold of invalid ciphertexts are received from its peer, limiting the attacker's ability to perform such oracle attacks.   

Memory Safety Vulnerabilities: Buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory corruption bugs in the underlying C libraries (liboqs) could be exploited by a sophisticated attacker to achieve code execution.

Mitigation: Using a memory-safe language like Python for the main proxy logic provides a strong layer of protection. During development and testing, the reference implementation should be run with dynamic analysis tools like AddressSanitizer (ASAN) and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSAN) to detect and fix potential memory errors in the C bindings or underlying libraries.

Fault Injection Attacks: An attacker with physical access could use techniques like voltage glitching or laser fault injection to induce errors during cryptographic computations, potentially causing the device to leak secret information.

Mitigation: While primarily a hardware threat, some software-level mitigations are possible. For digital signatures, a simple and effective countermeasure is to perform the signing operation twice and verify that the outputs are identical before transmitting the signature. This can detect transient faults that may have occurred during one of the computations.   

Recommendations for Production Deployment
Transitioning from a reference implementation to a production system requires several strategic decisions to ensure security, robustness, and operational readiness.

Recommended Parameter Sets: For a general-purpose, balanced deployment, the combination of ML-KEM-768 and ML-DSA-65 is strongly recommended. This suite provides NIST Level 3 security, offering a conservative margin against future improvements in cryptanalysis, while demonstrating excellent performance on both ARM and x86 platforms. If bandwidth is the absolute primary constraint and the drone platform's FPU has been thoroughly vetted for constant-time behavior,    

Falcon-512 could be considered for its smaller signature size, but this comes with a reduction to NIST Level 1 security and increased implementation risk.

Rekeying Policy: A default time-based rekeying interval of 5 minutes is recommended. This provides a strong guarantee of forward secrecy. Crucially, the rekeying process should be cooperative. The GCS may initiate a rekey request, but the drone must have the ability to acknowledge and defer the computationally expensive operation until it is in a safe state (e.g., hovering), preventing cryptographic operations from impacting flight-critical tasks.

Fail-Safe Integration: The secure proxy must be integrated as a non-intrusive component of the drone's communication stack. It must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the flight controller's fundamental fail-safe mechanisms. The flight controller must have an independent "heartbeat" or watchdog timer that monitors the communication link, and if the link is lost for any reason (including a proxy failure), it must immediately trigger the pre-programmed return-to-launch or landing procedure.

Hybrid Mode with Classical Cryptography: For all initial production deployments, a hybrid cryptographic mode is essential. This involves combining a PQC primitive with a well-vetted classical one. For example, the key establishment could use X25519 + ML-KEM-768. The shared secrets from both the ECDH exchange and the KEM decapsulation would be concatenated and fed as the IKM into the HKDF. This approach provides defense-in-depth; the connection remains secure as long as at least one of the constituent algorithms is unbroken. This mitigates the risk of an unforeseen vulnerability being discovered in the relatively new PQC algorithms. Furthermore, this hybrid approach is a powerful enabler for operational migration. A system capable of negotiating a hybrid connection can maintain backward compatibility with legacy systems that only support classical cryptography, allowing for a gradual, phased rollout of PQC across a heterogeneous fleet of drones and ground stations without disrupting operations.   

Conclusion and Strategic Recommendations
This report has presented a comprehensive framework for designing, implementing, and analyzing a post-quantum secure communication proxy for drone-to-GCS links. The analysis is grounded in the latest standards from NIST and leverages a robust ecosystem of open-source cryptographic libraries.

Summary of Key Findings
Feasibility and Standardization: A secure proxy built exclusively on NIST-standardized PQC algorithms is not only feasible but is supported by a mature set of cryptographic primitives (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, Falcon, SLH-DSA) and high-quality open-source implementations (liboqs, PQClean).

Protocol Design: A hybrid TCP/UDP protocol provides an optimal balance of reliability for the critical key-exchange handshake and low-latency for real-time data transport. A carefully designed authenticated key exchange protocol, which signs a transcript of all session parameters, is essential to prevent sophisticated MitM and replay attacks.

Performance Trade-offs: The choice of signature algorithm presents a clear trade-off.

ML-DSA offers a strong, balanced performance profile suitable for general use.

Falcon provides significant bandwidth savings at the cost of increased implementation complexity and lower security at its most compact level.

SPHINCS+ offers the most conservative security guarantees but is likely too slow and data-intensive for the primary real-time channel.

Implementation Hardening: The primary implementation risk for the selected lattice-based algorithms is side-channel vulnerability. Adherence to constant-time coding principles, as championed by the PQClean project, is not an optimization but a fundamental security requirement.

Operational Robustness: The large packet sizes inherent to PQC can significantly degrade performance on unreliable, lossy wireless links due to IP fragmentation. Algorithm choices that minimize packet size can enhance operational robustness in these environments.

Final Recommendations for the PQC Drone↔GCS Secure-Proxy Project
Based on the comprehensive analysis conducted, the following strategic recommendations are provided:

Proceed with Implementation: The project is technically sound and addresses a critical, forward-looking security requirement. The proposed design provides a robust foundation for a secure and resilient communication system.

Adopt a Balanced Default Suite: For initial development, testing, and deployment, the recommended cryptographic suite is ML-KEM-768 for key encapsulation and ML-DSA-65 for digital signatures. This suite provides a conservative NIST Level 3 security posture with excellent, well-understood performance characteristics on both embedded and server-class hardware.

Prioritize Implementation Security: The development process must prioritize security hardening, with a specific focus on mitigating side-channel attacks. This includes exclusively using PQClean-derived, constant-time implementations and conducting rigorous testing with dynamic analysis tools.

Deploy in Hybrid Mode: The initial production rollout should utilize a hybrid scheme combining classical and post-quantum algorithms (e.g., X25519 + ML-KEM-768). This strategy provides the strongest possible security posture by hedging against unforeseen weaknesses in the new PQC standards and facilitates a gradual, interoperable migration across the drone fleet.

Conduct Extensive Real-World Testing: While lab-based emulation provides critical data, the final validation must occur under real-world wireless conditions. Extensive field testing is necessary to fully characterize the protocol's performance and robustness in the presence of real-world radio frequency interference, signal fading, and network congestion.

By following these recommendations, the PQC Drone↔GCS Secure-Proxy project can deliver a solution that not only meets the immediate security requirements but also provides a resilient, future-proof foundation for secure unmanned aerial systems operations in the quantum era.
