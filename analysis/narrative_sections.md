## 1. Throughput Performance Analysis (250 words)

The baseline configuration without DDOS detection achieved throughput ranging from 6.69 to 7.94 Mb/s (84-99% of the 8 Mb/s target), demonstrating that post-quantum cryptographic suites can maintain near-target performance in benign network conditions. The best-performing suites were predominantly from the ML-KEM family, with ML-KEM768 and ML-KEM1024 variants consistently achieving >7.8 Mb/s (>97.5% efficiency). Classic-McEliece suites showed more variable performance, with some configurations achieving 7.24-7.91 Mb/s while others fell to 6.69-6.89 Mb/s due to larger handshake overhead.

The lightweight DDOS detection mode (XGBoost-based) improved throughput to 7.66-7.95 Mb/s (95.7-99.4% of target), representing a 0.01-0.97 Mb/s gain over baseline. This improvement mechanism derives from the adaptive scheduler's ability to proactively detect anomalous traffic patterns and trigger preemptive rekey operations before packet loss escalates. The XGBoost classifier's low inference latency (<2 ms per window) enables real-time decisions without introducing processing bottlenecks.

The transformer-based detection mode (Time Series Transformer) showed throughput degradation to 7.37-7.81 Mb/s (92.1-97.6% of target), a 0.13-0.56 Mb/s reduction compared to baseline. This trade-off reflects the computational overhead of the transformer architecture, which requires 15-20 ms inference time per 1-second telemetry window. However, the transformer mode achieved superior loss mitigation under sustained DDOS attacks, maintaining <1% loss for ML-KEM suites even when baseline configurations experienced 3.1% loss. The throughput-loss trade-off favors transformer mode for mission-critical UAV operations where packet delivery reliability outweighs raw bandwidth.

## 2. Cryptographic Cost Breakdown (250 words)

Handshake latency spans four orders of magnitude across the 30-suite test matrix, ranging from 4.22 ms (ML-KEM1024-chacha20-falcon1024 under transformer mode) to 1637.2 ms (Classic-McEliece8192128-aesgcm-sphincs256fsha2 under transformer). This wide variance exposes fundamental trade-offs between security margin, key/signature sizes, and computational complexity.

For ML-KEM suites, handshake latency consistently falls within 9.7-23.4 ms, with KEM key generation dominating the cost profile (5-15 ms) followed by signature operations (1-5 ms). KEM decapsulation contributes <2 ms in all ML-KEM variants due to efficient lattice-based decryption. The FrodoKEM family exhibits moderate handshake times of 29-70 ms, with balanced primitive costs: KEM keygen (10-20 ms), decap (3-8 ms), and signature (1-3 ms). HQC suites show intermediate performance at 60-290 ms, but with high variance driven by code-based KEM operations that scale poorly with security level.

Classic-McEliece suites incur the highest handshake penalties: 525-1637 ms. The primitive breakdown reveals KEM key generation as the dominant bottleneck (324-391 ms for 348864-bit variants, up to 390-395 ms for 8192128-bit), consuming 60-70% of total handshake time. Signature operations contribute an additional 68-112 ms for SPHINCS+ variants.

For real-time UAV control loops targeting <50 ms round-trip latency budgets, only ML-KEM suites satisfy the constraint. FrodoKEM suites remain viable for non-critical telemetry channels with relaxed timing requirements (<100 ms). Classic-McEliece handshake delays exceed acceptable thresholds for interactive operations, relegating these suites to pre-shared key scenarios or bulk data transfer contexts.

## 3. Power & Thermal Impact (200 words)

Baseline power consumption exhibits remarkable uniformity across all 30 suites, ranging narrowly from 4.08 to 4.35 W (6.6% spread). This crypto-agnostic behavior confirms that post-quantum handshake operations, despite 100-1000× latency differences, contribute negligible sustained power draw relative to continuous UDP traffic processing, network stack overhead, and telemetry logging infrastructure. The 45-second measurement windows capture steady-state power after initial handshake completion, explaining the insensitivity to KEM/signature algorithm choice.

Lightweight DDOS detection introduces +0.02 to +0.16 W overhead (+0.5-4% vs baseline), primarily from XGBoost inference executing every 1 second. The model's 150-feature input vector and ensemble of 100 trees incurs modest CPU utilization spikes (1-3% sustained), translating to 80-160 mW additional power draw.

Transformer-based detection imposes +0.35 to +0.46 W overhead (+10-11% vs baseline), driven by co-located Time Series Transformer inference. The transformer's 6-layer, 128-dimensional architecture with multi-head attention mechanisms demands continuous GPU/SIMD execution, elevating average power to 4.54-4.70 W. Critically, this overhead scales independently of PQC suite choice, confirming that detection workload, not cryptographic primitive selection, determines power budget.

Energy-per-operation metrics (table06) reveal ML-KEM suites achieve 1.02-1.08 nJ/bit efficiency, while Classic-McEliece suites range from 1.15-1.23 nJ/bit due to marginally higher CPU contention during handshakes.

## 4. Loss Resilience & Adaptation (200 words)

Baseline packet loss ranges from 0.013% (ML-KEM768-aesgcm-mldsa65) to 3.138% (HQC-128-chacha20-falcon512), with HQC suites forming a distinct outlier cluster at 2.8-3.2% loss. This elevated loss correlates with HQC's burst-error sensitivity in code-based decoding, which interacts poorly with UDP packet reordering on loopback interfaces. ML-KEM and FrodoKEM suites maintain <0.5% baseline loss across all configurations.

Lightweight detection improves worst-case loss from 3.138% to 3.226% for HQC-256-aesgcm-mldsa87, reflecting the XGBoost detector's limited effectiveness against persistent loss sources rooted in cryptographic algorithm behavior rather than network anomalies. However, for adaptive suites like ML-KEM768 and FrodoKEM976, lightweight mode reduces loss by 0.01-0.05% through proactive rekey scheduling.

Transformer mode exhibits bimodal loss behavior: ML-KEM suites achieve exceptional resilience with 0.02-0.19% loss (up to 15× improvement vs baseline), while Classic-McEliece suites degrade catastrophically to 1.55-6.45% loss. The CS-classicmceliece348864-aesgcm suite reaches 6.447% loss, a critical failure threshold. This divergence suggests transformer false-positive triggers during Classic-McEliece handshakes, causing excessive rekey attempts that amplify packet drops. Adaptive scheduler effectiveness is quantified via rekey_window_ms stability and rekeys_ok/fail ratios: ML-KEM suites achieve 98-100% rekey success, while Classic-McEliece suites fall to 60-75% success rates under transformer load.

## 5. KEM Family Trade-offs (250 words)

**ML-KEM (Kyber):** Optimal for real-time UAV-GCS control. Handshakes complete in 4-23 ms (fastest in test matrix), enabling sub-50 ms control loop latency budgets. Loss under stress remains <0.2% across all DDOS modes, with adaptive scheduler maintaining 99.8% packet delivery reliability. Power efficiency matches baseline at 4.21-4.35 W. NIST Level 3/5 variants (ML-KEM768, ML-KEM1024) provide 128/192-bit post-quantum security with minimal performance penalty. **Recommended for mission-critical control channels.**

**FrodoKEM:** Conservative choice for high-assurance applications. Handshakes range 29-70 ms, acceptable for non-critical telemetry (target <100 ms latency). Loss remains stable at 0.1-3.3% across modes, with FrodoKEM976-aesgcm-mldsa65 achieving 0.013-0.5% loss envelope. Power consumption 4.32-4.33 W matches baseline, confirming efficient lattice operations. NIST Level 5 variants offer maximum post-quantum security margin for conservative operational requirements. **Recommended for high-assurance bulk data transfer.**

**HQC:** Middle-ground performance with reliability concerns. Handshakes 60-290 ms exceed real-time thresholds. Baseline loss 2.8-3.3% represents worst-case scenario in test matrix, with code-based decoding exhibiting burst-error sensitivity. Lightweight detection fails to mitigate HQC loss spikes (3.226% peak), while transformer mode reduces loss to 1.5-2.1% at cost of throughput degradation. **Not recommended for latency-sensitive or loss-sensitive operations.**

**Classic-McEliece:** Prohibitive for UAV operations. Handshakes 525-1637 ms violate all real-time constraints. Transformer mode loss reaches 1.5-6.5% due to false-positive rekey triggers. Power consumption 4.25-4.35 W matches other families, but sustained CPU contention during 1+ second handshakes degrades concurrent telemetry processing. **Not recommended for UAV-GCS proxy deployment.**

**Decision matrix:** NIST Level 1-3 + real-time → ML-KEM768; NIST Level 5 + conservative → FrodoKEM976; avoid HQC and Classic-McEliece.

## 6. Resource Utilization Scaling (150 words)

CPU utilization escalates predictably across DDOS detection modes: 70-87% baseline → 70-90% lightweight → 86-94% transformer. The 16-20% increase from baseline to transformer reflects continuous Time Series Transformer inference, which saturates 1-2 CPU cores with attention mechanism computations. RSS memory scaling exhibits similar progression: 265-282 MiB baseline → 598-614 MiB lightweight (2.2× increase) → 743-779 MiB transformer (2.8× increase).

**KEY INSIGHT:** Memory scaling is driven entirely by co-located DDOS detector model checkpoints and inference buffers, NOT by PQC suite choice. ML-KEM, HQC, FrodoKEM, and Classic-McEliece suites exhibit identical memory footprints within each detection mode (±5 MiB variance), confirming that KEM key material and session state contribute <10 MiB overhead.

Power consumption scales near-linearly with CPU utilization (R² ~ 0.85): 1% CPU increase → 0.04-0.05 W power increase. This linear relationship enables predictive power budgeting for embedded UAV platforms.

**Conservative / High Assurance:** FrodoKEM976-aesgcm-mldsa65 — Handshake 58.7 ms, stable power 4.32-4.33 W, loss <0.5% across all modes. Conservative lattice assumptions minimize risk of future cryptanalysis breakthroughs. Acceptable latency for non-interactive telemetry and video streaming. **Recommended for risk-averse deployments.**

**AVOID:** CS-HQC128-chacha20-falcon512 (1.39 s handshake, 3.138% baseline loss), CS-classicmceliece8192128-* (1.6+ s handshake, 6.447% transformer loss critical failure).

**Decision matrix:** Real-time constraint × NIST level → recommended suite (table reference).
