4. POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ARCHITECTURE AND IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

4.1 CRYPTOGRAPHIC SYSTEM DESIGN

The post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) implementation for drone-to-ground control station (GCS) communication addresses the quantum threat to current cryptographic protocols used in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations. Our system implements a comprehensive suite of NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms integrated into a hybrid transport architecture specifically designed for constrained drone environments.

4.1.1 Hybrid Transport Protocol Architecture

The cryptographic system employs a novel hybrid TCP/UDP transport mechanism that separates the authentication phase from the data transmission phase:

- TCP Channel: Handles the initial post-quantum handshake protocol, ensuring reliable delivery of cryptographic material and authentication tokens
- UDP Channel: Carries encrypted application data with optimized AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) framing for low-latency drone telemetry

This separation addresses the dual requirements of drone communication: reliable cryptographic establishment and low-latency data transmission critical for real-time flight control.

4.1.2 Post-Quantum Algorithm Integration

The implementation incorporates three families of NIST-approved post-quantum cryptographic algorithms:

Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEM):
- ML-KEM-512 (NIST Level 1): 128-bit post-quantum security
- ML-KEM-768 (NIST Level 3): 192-bit post-quantum security  
- ML-KEM-1024 (NIST Level 5): 256-bit post-quantum security

Digital Signature Algorithms:
- ML-DSA (Dilithium variants): ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-65, ML-DSA-87
- Falcon: Falcon-512, Falcon-1024
- SPHINCS+: SLH-DSA-SHA2-128f, SLH-DSA-SHA2-256f

Symmetric Cryptography:
- AES-256-GCM for authenticated encryption
- HKDF-SHA256 for key derivation following NIST SP 800-56C

4.2 CRYPTOGRAPHIC SUITE MATRIX

The system implements 21 distinct cryptographic suites across three NIST security levels, providing comprehensive coverage of post-quantum algorithm combinations:

NIST Level 1 Suites (7 combinations):
- cs-mlkem512-aesgcm-mldsa44
- cs-mlkem512-aesgcm-mldsa65  
- cs-mlkem512-aesgcm-mldsa87
- cs-mlkem512-aesgcm-falcon512
- cs-mlkem512-aesgcm-falcon1024
- cs-mlkem512-aesgcm-sphincs128fsha2
- cs-mlkem512-aesgcm-sphincs256fsha2

NIST Level 3 Suites (7 combinations):
- cs-mlkem768-aesgcm-mldsa44
- cs-mlkem768-aesgcm-mldsa65
- cs-mlkem768-aesgcm-mldsa87  
- cs-mlkem768-aesgcm-falcon512
- cs-mlkem768-aesgcm-falcon1024
- cs-mlkem768-aesgcm-sphincs128fsha2
- cs-mlkem768-aesgcm-sphincs256fsha2

NIST Level 5 Suites (7 combinations):
- cs-mlkem1024-aesgcm-mldsa44
- cs-mlkem1024-aesgcm-mldsa65
- cs-mlkem1024-aesgcm-mldsa87
- cs-mlkem1024-aesgcm-falcon512  
- cs-mlkem1024-aesgcm-falcon1024
- cs-mlkem1024-aesgcm-sphincs128fsha2
- cs-mlkem1024-aesgcm-sphincs256fsha2

Each suite combines a specific ML-KEM variant with a signature algorithm and AES-256-GCM AEAD, providing different security-performance trade-offs suitable for various operational scenarios.

4.3 RUNTIME CRYPTOGRAPHIC AGILITY

A novel contribution of this implementation is the runtime cryptographic suite switching capability, enabling dynamic algorithm changes during active communication sessions without connection interruption.

4.3.1 In-Band Control Protocol

The system implements an encrypted in-band control channel using packet type 0x02 for cryptographic negotiation. The control protocol employs a two-phase commit mechanism:

Phase 1 - Preparation:
- GCS sends prepare_rekey message with target suite identifier
- Drone validates suite availability and security constraints
- Drone responds with commit_rekey or prepare_fail

Phase 2 - Execution:  
- Both endpoints perform new PQC handshake with target algorithms
- New session keys derived using HKDF-SHA256
- Traffic resumes with new cryptographic context
- Epoch counter incremented to prevent replay attacks

4.3.2 Control State Machine

The control protocol is implemented as a finite state machine with the following states:

RUNNING: Normal operation with established cryptographic context
NEGOTIATING: Processing suite change request, validating new algorithms
SWAPPING: Performing new handshake with target suite
FAILURE: Handling negotiation failures, reverting to previous state

State transitions are protected by mutex locks to ensure thread safety in the multi-threaded proxy implementation.

4.4 SECURITY PROPERTIES AND GUARANTEES

4.4.1 Forward Secrecy

The implementation provides forward secrecy through ephemeral key generation:
- Each session uses fresh ML-KEM keypairs
- Session keys derived from ephemeral shared secrets
- Previous session keys cannot decrypt future communications
- Runtime suite switching generates new ephemeral keys

4.4.2 Replay Protection

A sliding window mechanism prevents replay attacks:
- 1024-packet sliding window per communication direction
- Sequence numbers with epoch-based reset
- Deterministic nonce generation prevents IV reuse
- Out-of-window packets silently dropped with logging

4.4.3 Authentication and Integrity

Multi-layer authentication ensures communication integrity:
- GCS identity verified through pre-shared signature verification
- Drone authentication via pre-shared key (PSK) mechanism
- Per-packet authentication through AES-GCM authenticated encryption
- Control messages authenticated within encrypted channel
