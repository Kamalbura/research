# 4. Post-Quantum Cryptographic Framework

This section presents our novel post-quantum cryptographic framework for securing drone-to-ground control station communication against quantum computational threats. Our system addresses the critical need for quantum-resistant security in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems while maintaining operational requirements for real-time flight control.

## 4.1 Motivation and Threat Model

The emergence of quantum computing poses an existential threat to current drone communication security. Shor's algorithm enables polynomial-time factorization of RSA keys and discrete logarithm computation for elliptic curve cryptography [1]. Conservative estimates suggest cryptographically relevant quantum computers within 15-30 years, while UAV systems require 20-30 year operational security lifetimes.

    section Today
        Current Threat : "Harvest now, decrypt later" attacks
        UAV Deployment : 20-30 year security requirement
        
    section 15-30 Years
        Quantum Computers : Break RSA/ECC with ~2,000 logical qubits
        Cryptographic Impact : All current UAV security compromised
        
    section Our Solution
        Immediate PQC : Deploy quantum-resistant algorithms now
        Future-Proof : Algorithm agility for evolving threats
```

Our threat model considers quantum-capable adversaries with the ability to intercept and store current communications for future quantum decryption, perform active attacks during communication sessions, and exploit any algorithmic vulnerabilities in post-quantum schemes through cryptanalysis advances.

## 4.2 Novel Contributions

Our framework provides three key innovations beyond existing post-quantum communication systems:

### 4.2.1 Runtime Cryptographic Agility
**First implementation** enabling live algorithm switching in UAV systems without service interruption. This addresses the evolving nature of post-quantum cryptography where algorithm confidence may change over operational lifetimes.

### 4.2.2 Drone-Optimized Hybrid Protocol
**Novel hybrid TCP/UDP design** separating reliability-critical handshakes from latency-critical data transport, specifically optimized for UAV communication patterns rather than general-purpose protocols.

### 4.2.3 Comprehensive Algorithm Matrix
**Most complete implementation** of NIST post-quantum standards in UAV systems, supporting 21 validated suite combinations across all standardized algorithm families with full interoperability.

Our architecture separates cryptographic concerns into three distinct phases: **TCP-based handshake** for reliable post-quantum key establishment, **UDP data plane** for low-latency encrypted communication, and **control plane** for runtime algorithm management.

## 4.4 Post-Quantum Algorithm Integration

We implement all four NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithm families to provide cryptographic diversity and address different operational requirements:

        A2[ML-KEM-768<br/>Level 3 Security]
        A3[ML-KEM-1024<br/>Level 5 Security]
    end

    end

    A3 --> C
    B1 --> C
    B2 --> C
    B3 --> C
    
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
```

**Algorithm Selection Rationale**:
- **ML-KEM**: NIST FIPS 203 standard, lattice-based key exchange with proven security reductions
- **ML-DSA**: FIPS 204 lattice-based signatures, optimal performance-security balance  
- **Falcon**: Draft FIPS 206 NTRU-based, ultra-compact signatures for bandwidth constraints
- **SLH-DSA**: FIPS 205 hash-based, conservative security independent of number theory assumptions

## 4.5 Security Properties and Performance

Our security analysis demonstrates that the framework achieves **IND-CCA2 security** for confidentiality, **sEUF-CMA security** for authentication, and **perfect forward secrecy** through ephemeral key generation. The system provides quantum security levels equivalent to AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 through NIST Level 1, 3, and 5 parameters respectively.

**Performance Characteristics**:
- **Handshake**: <1 second completion time across all algorithm combinations
- **Data Plane**: 38-byte per-packet overhead, negligible latency impact
- **Memory**: 2-3 MB base requirements, suitable for embedded drone platforms
- **Throughput**: Comparable to classical systems after handshake completion

## 4.6 Validation and Implementation

Our implementation includes comprehensive validation through **109 automated test functions** covering all cryptographic correctness scenarios, protocol compliance verification, security property validation, and integration testing. Hardware validation demonstrates feasibility across Windows/Linux development environments and Raspberry Pi 4B drone platforms.

The framework integrates with the **Open Quantum Safe library** [2] for NIST-approved algorithm implementations while maintaining constant-time operations and side-channel resistance required for safety-critical UAV deployments.
