# 4. Post-Quantum Cryptographic Framework

This section presents our novel post-quantum cryptographic framework for securing drone-to-ground control station communication against quantum computational threats. Our system addresses the critical need for quantum-resistant security in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems while maintaining operational requirements for real-time flight control.

> **üìñ Note**: This section provides an academic overview of our contributions. For complete technical documentation, implementation details, and comprehensive diagrams, see [Technical Documentation](docs/technical/README.md).

## 4.1 Motivation and Threat Model

The emergence of quantum computing poses an existential threat to current drone communication security. Shor's algorithm enables polynomial-time factorization of RSA keys and discrete logarithm computation for elliptic curve cryptography [1]. Conservative estimates suggest cryptographically relevant quantum computers within 15-30 years, while UAV systems require 20-30 year operational security lifetimes.

    section Our Solution

        Future-Proof : Algorithm agility for evolving threats
```

Our threat model considers quantum-capable adversaries with the ability to intercept and store current communications for future quantum decryption, perform active attacks during communication sessions, and exploit any algorithmic vulnerabilities in post-quantum schemes through cryptanalysis advances.

## 4.2 Novel Contributions

Our framework provides three key innovations beyond existing post-quantum communication systems:

### 4.2.1 Runtime Cryptographic Agility
**First implementation** enabling live algorithm switching in UAV systems without service interruption. This addresses the evolving nature of post-quantum cryptography where algorithm confidence may change over operational lifetimes.

### 4.2.2 Drone-Optimized Hybrid Protocol
**Novel hybrid TCP/UDP design** separating reliability-critical handshakes from latency-critical data transport, specifically optimized for UAV communication patterns rather than general-purpose protocols.

### 4.2.3 Comprehensive Algorithm Matrix
**Most complete implementation** of NIST post-quantum standards in UAV systems, supporting 21 validated suite combinations across all standardized algorithm families with full interoperability.

Our architecture separates cryptographic concerns into three distinct phases: **TCP-based handshake** for reliable post-quantum key establishment, **UDP data plane** for low-latency encrypted communication, and **control plane** for runtime algorithm management.

### 4.3.1 Simplified Handshake Walkthrough

1. **Handshake channel setup** ‚Äì The drone opens a TCP connection to the GCS handshake port. No application data flows until the handshake completes.
2. **Signed ServerHello** ‚Äì The GCS sends a post-quantum signed transcript containing the negotiated suite identifiers, an 8-byte session identifier, an 8-byte challenge, and the ML-KEM public key. The drone verifies the signature with the pre-installed GCS public key (certificate-equivalent) and enforces the expected suite and wire version.
3. **Drone authentication and KEM response** ‚Äì The drone encapsulates the ML-KEM shared secret, then returns the ciphertext together with an HMAC-SHA256 tag computed using the 32-byte pre-shared key (`DRONE_PSK`). The GCS rejects the handshake if the tag fails comparison.
4. **Key derivation** ‚Äì Both parties feed the shared secret into HKDF-SHA256 (salt `pq-drone-gcs|hkdf|v1`, info bound to the session and suite identifiers) to derive independent AES-256-GCM keys for drone‚ÜíGCS and GCS‚Üídrone directions, plus nonce seeds tied to the session.
5. **Bidirectional encrypted data plane** ‚Äì With keys established, UDP traffic traverses an AES-256-GCM tunnel that attaches a fixed 22-byte authenticated header (wire version, suite IDs, session, epoch, sequence). Replay protection uses a 1024-bit sliding window, and epochs increment on every rekey.

The accompanying diagram in `diagrames.md` (‚ÄúHandshake & Encrypted Channel Layout‚Äù) illustrates these steps with the drone rendered on the left, the encrypted channel in the center, and the ground control station on the right.

## 4.4 Post-Quantum Algorithm Integration

We implement all four NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithm families to provide cryptographic diversity and address different operational requirements:

**Algorithm Selection Rationale**:
- **ML-KEM**: NIST FIPS 203 standard, lattice-based key exchange with proven security reductions
- **ML-DSA**: FIPS 204 lattice-based signatures, optimal performance-security balance  
- **Falcon**: Draft FIPS 206 NTRU-based, ultra-compact signatures for bandwidth constraints
- **SLH-DSA**: FIPS 205 hash-based, conservative security independent of number theory assumptions

## 4.5 Security Properties and Performance

Our security analysis demonstrates that the framework achieves **IND-CCA2 security** for confidentiality, **sEUF-CMA security** for authentication, and **perfect forward secrecy** through ephemeral key generation. The system provides quantum security levels equivalent to AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 through NIST Level 1, 3, and 5 parameters respectively.

**Performance Characteristics**:
- **Handshake**: <1 second completion time across all algorithm combinations
- **Data Plane**: 38-byte per-packet overhead, negligible latency impact
- **Memory**: 2-3 MB base requirements, suitable for embedded drone platforms
- **Throughput**: Comparable to classical systems after handshake completion
