TITLE: How We Measure and What We Report
VERSION: 1.0

KPIs:
- Handshake latency (ms) and bytes
- Per-packet added latency p50/p95 (µs/ms) by payload size
- Throughput (pkts/s, Mbps)
- CPU% (RPi 4B) and energy/packet (mJ) → estimated flight-time delta
- DDoS metrics: AUC/PR-AUC, FPR@TPR=0.99, detection latency, CPU under attack
- RL metrics: reward vs baselines, suite timeline, SLA violations

Methods:
- Latency: embed send-timestamp in plaintext payload before encrypt, echo back; subtract on receive.
- Energy: USB inline meter (or power hooks) → (avg_power_active - idle) * duration / packets.
- CPU: psutil or top sampling at 1 Hz.
- Net impairments: tc/netem (delay, loss, reorder) for reproducibility.

Figures (suggested):
- Latency CDF per suite (64/256/512/1024B)
- Handshake ms/bytes table across suites
- CPU% and mJ/packet bars
- DDoS ROC/PR curves; time-series under attack
- RL action timeline overlaid with loss/latency

Ground Truth:
- Keep raw CSVs in benchmarks/results; regenerate figures from CSVs only.
